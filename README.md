A basic implementation of a block and blockchain, including a ProofOfWork type that can be used to validate that the appropriate amount of work was done to add a block to a blockchain.

A block contains a piece of string data, a timestamp, the previous block's hash, and the block's hash.

A blockchain simply consists of an array of blocks.
